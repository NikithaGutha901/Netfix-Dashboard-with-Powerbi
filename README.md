# 🎥 Netflix Dashboard with Power BI

## 📝 Project Overview
This project explores a **real-time Netflix dataset** from Kaggle, showcasing the transformation of raw data into actionable insights using **Power BI**. The dashboard highlights key metrics and visualizations, enabling deeper understanding of trends in Netflix content, ratings, and user engagement.

## 🔧 Key Features
### 1. **ETL and Data Preparation**
- Cleaned and transformed the dataset to ensure data integrity.
- Handled missing values and created conditional columns to enhance analysis.

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Analyzed key metrics, including:
  - Total votes and average ratings.
  - Votes per title and percentage distribution of votes for movies vs. TV shows.
  - Total count of movie titles, TV shows, and their respective ratings and votes.

### 3. **Advanced DAX Calculations**
- Applied **DAX formulas** for dynamic calculations, such as:
  - Average ratings and votes.
  - Aggregated sums of votes for movies and TV shows.

### 4. **Interactive Dashboard Design**
- Created an engaging and user-friendly dashboard with:
  - **Slicers** for filtering data dynamically.
  - **Multi-row cards** for key metrics.
  - **Maps, tables, stacked column charts, and funnel charts** to visualize data effectively.
  - **Tooltips**: Incorporated dynamic tooltips for deeper data exploration, featuring:
    - **Gauge Chart** to display the progress or performance of key metrics.
    - **Doughnut Chart** to show proportional breakdowns, especially useful for visualizing the distribution of votes across movies and TV shows.

## 🎯 Key Insights
- Identified trends in user ratings and voting patterns across movies and TV shows.
- Highlighted the distribution of titles and engagement metrics for better content analysis.

## 💡 Learnings
